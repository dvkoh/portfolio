Interactive components of curiosity inducing conversations and design considerations in transitioning such human experiences into agent interactions are identified through design workshops. \n\nFrom these findings, an initial version of the design guideline for generating curiosity inducing conversational agents is developed. The guideline is revised through designer interviews, where design implications of designing for user curiosity in conversational interfaces are further extracted.\n\nThis thesis contributes by proposing a new perspective to designing conversational interactions centered around the notion of arousing user curiosity. This is in stark contrast to the trends of supporting user discovery in conversational interfaces that had qualified their focus to the transactional qualities of conversations.",
